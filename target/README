### Data Structures

1. **GuestListManager**
   - Structures: `LinkedList<Guest>` + `Map<String, Guest>`
   - Reasoning:
     - `LinkedList` allows O(1) additions/removals at the ends.
     - `Map` provides O(1) lookup by `key = name-groupTag`.
     - Combination ensures fast guest management for both iteration and search.

2. **VenueSelector**
   - Structure: `List<Venue>`
   - Reasoning:
     - Maintains all venue options.
     - Linear search is sufficient because the list is small.
     - Allows easy iteration for selecting the cheapest venue within budget and capacity.

3. **SeatingPlanner**
   - Structures: `Map<String, Queue<Guest>>`, `Map<Integer, List<Guest>>`
   - Reasoning:
     - `Map<String, Queue<Guest>>` groups guests by groupTag for fair seating.
     - `Queue` ensures guests are seated in the order added.
     - `Map<Integer, List<Guest>>` maps table numbers to seated guests for quick access.

4. **TaskManager**
   - Structures: `Deque<Task>` for upcoming tasks, `Stack<Task>` for completed tasks.
   - Reasoning:
     - `Deque` provides FIFO order for task execution.
     - `Stack` allows LIFO undo for last completed task.

     ### Algorithms & Big-O Analysis

     | Operation                        | Complexity | Notes |
     |---------------------------------|------------|-------|
     | Add guest                         | O(1)       | Map insertion |
     | Lookup guest                       | O(1)       | Using Map key |
     | Remove guest                       | O(1)       | Map removal |
     | Select venue                        | O(n)       | Linear search through list of n venues |
     | Generate seating                   | O(g + t)   | g = total guests, t = total tables; each guest placed in a table |
     | Add task                            | O(1)       | Adding to Deque |
     | Execute next task                   | O(1)       | Poll from front of Deque |
     | Undo last task                      | O(1)       | Pop from Stack and reinsert into Deque |
